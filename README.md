# Sequelize-example
steps
1. npm init
2. npm install of:
    - 'express'
    - 'dotenv'
    - 'pg'        <- these both are for postgres
    - 'pg-hstore'  <-
    - 'sequelize'

3. made server folder 
4. made index.js inside server folder


Im basing most this code off of this offical example of Sequelize using express 
from the Sequelize dev team:
    https://github.com/sequelize/express-example

And also this Sequelize plural site video:
    https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=d838b2d3-a15a-4c4b-9df6-a32d15ccf524

Both of the above examples are using SQLite and a local hosted Database
in this code it is using postgres and a heroku hosted database
